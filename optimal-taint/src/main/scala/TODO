TODOs for jose
1.1 - Add pretty printing of abstracted/unwound code
2.2 - Add SMTLIB interface
3 - Full pipeline: collect traces, create smt formula, send to interpolator, identify source code positions
4 - Consider ways to reduce explosion of traces:
  - Note a while (_ < 100) (e.g.) results in 100 unwound if-statements,
   and thus in 100^2 possible traces from that single command (assuming no nesting to make
   things worse)....clearly this is untenable...
