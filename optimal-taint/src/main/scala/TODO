TODOs for jose
1 - Add tests for first cut of scala trace collector
2 - Add code to go back from trace condition to source code line
3 - Full pipeline to interpolator
4 - Consider ways to reduce explosion of traces:
  - Note a while (_ < 100) (e.g.) results in 100 unwound if-statements,
   and thus in 100^2 possible traces from that single command (assuming no nesting to make
   things worse)....clearly this is untenable...
