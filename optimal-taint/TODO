TODOs for jose
1 - Fix bug when adding instrumentation to code that has skips (i.e. empty branches)
2 - Add tests for interpolant minimization
3 - Consider ways to reduce explosion of traces:
  - Note a while (_ < 100) (e.g.) results in 100 unwound if-statements,
   and thus in 100^2 possible traces from that single command (assuming no nesting to make
   things worse)....clearly this is untenable...
